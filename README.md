# IsolationTankEnsemble
This is prototype for what I'd like to have as a website for my band Isolation Tank Ensemble. It is meant to be sparse and slightly 
esoteric as bands mostly use a combination of bandcamp & facebook. 

You won't need any special software to view this, and it uses bootstrap via the CDN.

I got stuck in a lot of places and want to thank Shannon Kempf, David Marquardt, Mikel Hensley, & Wes Wright for getting me through 
those spots that were simple, but were driving me crazy.
